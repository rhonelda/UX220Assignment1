# student portfolio goals

1. Goal-setting in academics and self-regulated learning: 
 Academic objectives/Learning Outcomes: According to Sharma (2007), academic objectives provide students with direction and inspire them to actively participate in the learning process. Self-Regulated Learning Goals: According to Zimmerman (2008b), self-regulated learning involves active development of learning goals by students. These objectives are frequently established by educational institutions and focus on the acquisition of specific skills and knowledge. This is consistent with the notion that successful goal-setting improves learning that is self-regulated. Both academic goals and self-regulated learning goals stress the significance of establishing precise learning objectives.

2. E-Portfolio and Personal Goal-Setting:ePortfolio Goals: According to Chang, Tseng, Chou, et al. (2011), ePortfolios frequently contain feedback, exceptional works, self-reflection, and personal goal-setting. These objectives in the context of an ePortfolio give students a way to record their educational progress and achievements. Construction of learning goals is another aspect of self-regulated learning, according to Zimmerman. This framework emphasizes the active involvement of students in creating and accomplishing their goals, and personal goal-setting within ePortfolios is consistent with the larger idea of self-regulated learning.


3. Contrasting:Academic goals and learning outcomes are frequently institutionally set and regulated within the framework of a formal education system. They are standardized across a curriculum and act as markers for student progress.
Self-regulated learning objectives and ePortfolio objectives: These objectives are more personalized and student-driven. They are the result of individual impulses, contemplations, and goals, enabling a more flexible and individualized approach to learning and skill development.

In conclusion, self-regulated learning objectives and ePortfolio goals offer a personalized and customizable approach, stressing individual growth, reflection, and skill development, in contrast to academic goals, which give a structured framework for learning within an institutional setting. Fostering efficient self-regulated learning and personal development depends on these objectives being in line with actual life desires.
